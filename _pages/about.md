Hi, I'm Marie M., professional penetration tester and stung by the security bug since 2012.

I have started this blog to share some of the knowledge, experience, gems, techniques, vulnerabilities, etc, that I come accross.
This is my humble attempt to give back to the community. It also forces me to finally structure my thoughts, cheatsheets and notes. So why not share them if they can profit you too!

You'll find here write-ups of challenges, conference notes, cheatsheets, tips... and of course, [The 5 hacking newsletter]({{ site.baseurl }}/category/newsletter)!

You can stay in touch with what <http://pentester.land> is up to through our [subscription form]({{ site.baseurl }}/subscribe.html). Also feel free to connect with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pentesterland), by [email](mailto:contact@pentester.land) or via the [contact form]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact.html).
