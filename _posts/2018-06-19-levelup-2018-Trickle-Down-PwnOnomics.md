Hi, these are the notes I took while watching the "Trickle Down PwnOnomics" talk given by [Darrell Damstedt (aka Hateshape)](https://twitter.com/hateshaped) on LevelUp 0x02 / 2018.

## Link
- Video: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vp03EtR5-TY&list=PLIK9nm3mu-S6gCKmlC5CDFhWvbEX9fNW6&index=3>

## About
- This talk is about how Hateshape "went from having zero bug bounty experience to regularly experiencing ($$$) success".
- Trickle Down Pwnonomics: A theory promoting the discovery and reduction of vulnerabilities on a bug bounty program as a means to stimulate my bank account.

## Helpful things
- Recommended tool for pentesters: [CrackMapExec](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/CrackMapExec) with the flag  \-\-darrell
- State of Infosec today:

### Helpful Thing #1: Learning from the mistakes of others
- Mistake #1 - Theories are not proof!
	- How much evidence do we need?
	- Do not submit reports that have theoretical possibilities as the whole meat of the report
	- No proof no glory

- Mistake #2 - Don't go too fast
	- At what point is a report warranted?
	- Do not submit bugs without explaining their impact
	- Showing the associated risk of a bug matters even after prooving the issue exists
- Mistake #3 - Scope can kill
	- Be sure an issue is in scope & owned by the program
- Mistake? #4 - Many may be one
	- If multiple instances of a vulnerability are found, should multiple reports be submitted or dhould the findings be aggregared into one report?
	- Risk: Ending up with 1 triage report and many not applicable
	- Common sense is if a bug requires the program to change their code to fix the issue, it's a finding that stands alone
	- Submit an aggregate report and trust that programs will truthfully tell us if a one change fixes everything

### Helpful Thing #2: Doing things nobody else wants to do
- Rely on manual analysis on top of using automated tools
	- Manually browse the full site
	- Read the HTML, JavaScript, etc
	- Read any and ALL product documentation (help documentation, administration documentation)
	- Cyber stalk developers, if possible
	- Github, Twitter, Reddit, Google, StackOverflow, Blogs, Forums
	- Read ALL the everything. Manually.
- Tools are great and should be used on every target
- Some tools
	- <https://github.com/nahamsec/JSParser>
	- <https://github.com/GerbenJavado/LinkFinder>
- Hateshape's seven 10K bounties were found manually

### Helpful Thing #3: Continuous monitoring
- Religiously monitor everything new in the bug bounty & penetration testing world
- Read everything you find
- Follow the awesome hunters on Twitter, blogs, RSS feeds, full disclosures, Hackerone hacktivity...
- What to do with all this information?
	- Read a blog post about how a researcher found an issue
	- Would you have found that bug?
	- If yes, compare how you could have found the issue and how the author of the blog post just found it
	- If not, try to figure out what you're not doing that would make you miss it
	- Try to figure out how to fill the gaps between the two
- Scrape Bugcrowd Top 200 public rankings via cron job daily all while being alerted to someone new rising in the ranks so you can follow them

## Success stories
- [How I Found CVE-2018-8819: Out-of-Band (OOB) XXE in WebCTRL](https://www.coalfire.com/The-Coalfire-Blog/June-2018/How-I-Found-CVE-2018-8819-Out-of-Band-(OOB)-XXE?feed=blogs)
	- Target scope: *
	- Recon done=
	- WebCTRL page found
	- Reference to help manual found in the source code
	- Read it ALL => nothing
	- WebCTRL version used => CVE of unauthenticated XXE but no details disclosed
	- Tried to reproduce it & found a new CVE
	- Great finding but N/A bug bounty report!
		- "The ISP providing the IP range did not update their ARIN records so it still shows up as an asset"
	- Consolation CVE + recon win
- Sploit summary
	- Found a target
	- Viewed all resources available (manually)
	- Found a potential issue (CVE)
	- No exploit was published, but knew the type of vulnerability
	- Did a ton of research & found nothing
	- James Kettle FTW
	- Working payload found through trial & error
	- No bounty, but CVE

## Reporting
- Details may be obvious... to us
- Don't be stingy, explain everything
- Write things once and well!
	- Jason Haddix uses report templates
- If the proof of concept is complicated, record it

## Duplicates
- Only possible solution: Go all crazy on your setup to placate yourself from the dupliacte issues

## Summary
- Tools are great, but they don't make up for thing that we don't know yet. Then can actually hold us back
- Embrace manual testing/discovery FTW
- Be honest with yourself
	- Know what you know & what you don't
- Fill in the gaps
- Read everything
	- both in targets you're testing & everything new publicly released by researchers
- Read everything again
- Take the advice that so many in this community freely give
