Hi, after our [5 tips to make the most of Twitter as a pentester or bug bounty hunter]({{url1}}) and [5 things I wish I knew as a junior penetration tester]({{url2}}), we continue our series of tips & tricks...

Here are 5 Kali Linux tricks **only known by Kali power users**!

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/{{page.image}}" alt="5-kali-tricks.png" >

## Install Kali tools anywhere with Kali Linux Git Repositories 
I don't know if this trick is well known because I haven't seen it documented anywhere. You can **install Kali Linux APT packages on any Debian machine**. Yes, any Debian, not Kali!.

Why would you wanna do that? Well, let's say your employer wants you to do tests from a Debian server. It happened to me, they wanted all tests to originate from the same IP and provided a shared Debian server.\\
Some tools are **only available as Kali packages**, and can't be found on Github or anywhere else. Also, installing tools with APT is always better because then they're **easier to update** (with `apt-get update && apt-get upgrade`).
<!--more-->

Here is how you do it:
1. Go to <http://git.kali.org/gitweb/>
2. Look for the tool you want. It must be available by default on Kali, like *lbd*
3. Click on "packages/lbd.git" (in the "Project" column) & copy the package's URL
4. Install the package on your Debian with: `git clone git://git.kali.org/packages/lbd.git`

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/tips-n-tricks/5-kali-tricks/git-lbd-2.PNG" alt="git-lbd-2.png" >

## Get the latest version of each tool

**Tools** installed **on Kali aren't always up to date**. You can check which version is used by going to the **Kali Linux Package Tracker** on <https://pkg.kali.org/>.

Let's look for "sqlmap":

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/tips-n-tricks/5-kali-tricks/pkg-tracker.PNG" alt="pkg-tracker.png" >

We can see some information on the package including which version is installed and the tool's original link:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/tips-n-tricks/5-kali-tricks/slmap_kali_version.PNG" alt="slmap_kali_version.png" >

As you can see Sqlmap isn't up to date on Kali:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/tips-n-tricks/5-kali-tricks/slmap_latest_version.PNG" alt="slmap_latest_version.png" >

So the Kali Linux Package Tracker is very useful to:
- **Get information** on tools, especially the version installed
- **Check original links** & Git repositories
- If necessary, **install the latest versions** using these original links

## Get the latest ISO with Kali Linux Weekly Builds

Kali Rolling packages are updated very regularly but the main **Kali Linux Images** (or ISOs) are only released a few times a year. So they **don't include the latest updates**.

That's why when you install an ISO, you have to suffer a humongous package upgrade when you do your first `apt-get update && apt-get upgrade`.

You can avoid that by using the **weekly releases of Kali images**, available at <http://cdimage.kali.org/kali-images/kali-weekly/>:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/tips-n-tricks/5-kali-tricks/kali-weekly-builds-2.PNG" alt="kali-weekly-builds-2.png" >

These are fresh ISOs, released once a week (on Sunday) and ship the latest tools:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/tips-n-tricks/5-kali-tricks/kali-weekly-builds.PNG" alt="kali-weekly-builds.png" >

## Leverage tools available in /usr/share/
The folder /usr/share/ contains many **interesting resources** that we can leverage during penetration tests.

Here are some examples:
- `/usr/share/wordlists/` contains many **wordlists** for password, username, file & directory bruteforce and more
- `/usr/share/webshells/` contains some direct & reverse **webshells** categorized by language (php,jsp, asp...)
- `usr/share/nmap/scripts/*.nse` contain the source code of **Nmap NSE scripts**. So we can check what a script does & if it is safe to use (i.e. no risk of Denial of Service) without using the Internet
- `/usr/share/uniscan/`, `/usr/share/recon-ng`, `/usr/share/dnsenum`...: contain either the **source code** of some tools **or resources** they use (wordlists)
- `/usr/share/background`: **wallpapers**
- ...

I particularly love the webshells because they're clean. When we upload something to a server, we want to know what it does. We don't want to introduce additional backdoors.

[C99.php](https://thehackerblog.com/every-c99-php-shell-is-backdoored-aka-free-shells/index.html) is an infamous webshell that had a lot of cool functionalities but was backdoored! If you uploaded it to a server, anyone could bypass its authentication and abuse it.

That's why I prefer using custom made webshells or the ones on Kali even if they have less features. At least, they can be trusted.

## Automate OS upgrades & Always do a backup before
Kali rolling isn't a stable distribution. It's great because it is continuously upgraded. New features and tools are added all the time. But the downside is that the **risk of crashes is high**.

Here are two things I noticed from personal experience:
- The more I waited before upgrading it, the more chances of causing a crash when I did
- When doing an upgrade, there is always a risk for completely breaking Kali

Two simple actions can help up minimize this risk:
1. **Always do a backup before an upgrade**. If using a Virtual Machine, take a VM snapshot. And if using Kali as the main OS, backup your important data. Also, don't upgrade just before an important mission (see why in the story below...).
2. **Upgrade regularly** (I mean really regularly, like every day)

Here is a little script to automate the process:
```
#!/bin/bash
echo '########################### aptitude update'
aptitude update
echo '########################### aptitude safe-upgrade'
aptitude safe-upgrade
echo '########################### aptitude dist-upgrade'
aptitude dist-upgrade
echo '########################### aptitude clean'
aptitude clean
```

Copy these contents to update_os.sh then run it manually:
```
chmod +x update_os.sh
./update_os.sh
```

You could also run this script as a cron job for totally automated upgrades, and use the `-y` option (`aptitude safe-upgrade -y`) to avoid being prompted for confirmation.\\
Being a paranoid, I prefer the manual approach.

For the little story, I once had the great idea to upgrade my Kali the night before a pentest. Right after, all text displayed looked like this: `[][]`.\\
Some critical fonts were uninstalled and ALL TEXT was rendered as little rectangles! I had to look for information on a second device, and install common fonts one by one until it was solved...

Since this bad night's sleep, I never use the `-y` option and always check the packages that will be removed by an upgrade:
