twitter-description: Our weekly favorite websec videos, articles, tips, tweets and more, curated with love for hackers by a hacker!
---
Hey hackers! These are our latest favorite resources related to pentest & bug bounty.

This issue exceptionally covers two weeks, from 31 of August to 14 of September.

## Our favorite 5 hacking items

### 1. Tutorial of the week
> [A practical guide to testing the security of Amazon Web Services (Part 1: AWS S3)](https://blog.mindedsecurity.com/2018/09/a-practical-guide-to-testing-security.html)

There is so much to learn to become a successful pentester/bug hunter. I can't remember which famous bug hunter once said that it used to take him 9 month to learn about a new vulnerability!

That's why I love this kind of comprehensive guides. It goes from the basics as if you've never heard of AWS S3 to advanced concepts on their security and how to test them for misconfigurations.

### 2. Tool of the week
> [Script for gathering domains/subdomains with IPRanges of organization](https://medium.com/@arbazhussain/gathering-domains-subdomains-with-ipranges-of-organization-49362d8a1271)

I am currently trying to improve my recon process, mainly to find new targets (domains & subdomains) as quickly as they become available. So this script comes very handy and complements other more known tools.

It resolves each IP in a given IP range by checking if port 443 is open, retrieves the SSL certificate from port 443 and scrapes it for domains & subdomains.

### 3. Resource of the week
> [Global scan - exposed .git repos](https://lynt.cz/blog/global-scan-exposed-git)

I stumbled upon this article right after discovering a .git folder exposed on a bug bounty target. I was amazed at how easy it was to retrieve parts of the company's source code and was wondering about the extent of this vulnerability.

This research answers the question and gives a great example of how to scale your hunt for such simple bugs.

### 4. Writeup of the week
> [Account Takeover in Periscope TV](https://hackerone.com/reports/317476)

Host headers attacks are usually associated with reset password pages or cache poisoning. From what I understood, this is a new way to exploit host headers attacks: it targets the OAuth implementation used to log into Periscope via Twitter.

Here is how I understand the attack:
- Go to <https://www.periscope.tv/> & click login with twitter
- Intercept the request with Burp & change the host header to *hackerone.com/www.periscope.tv* (instead of *www.periscope.tv*)
- A URL is returned: <https://twitter.com/oauth/authenticate?oauth_token=...> Send it to the victim
- The victim opens it and has already authorized the Periscope app in Twitter
- He/she is redirected to <https://www.example.com/www.periscope.tv/i/twitter/loginComplete?oauth_token=[attacker's oauth token]&oauth_verifier=[victim's oauth verifier]>
- So the attacker receives on his/her server the victim's oauth_verifier. He/she can takeover the victim's account by reusing the same *oauth_token* & *oauth_verifier*

### 5. Conference of the week
> [Bounty Hunters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8NkD7fSD24) by J Wolfgang Goerlich (GrrCon 2018)

I started this blog as a penetration tester, but I confess that I have been obsessed with bug hunting for months.

This is a nice talk about some bugs found by bug hunters on big companies and how to protect against them. The way the stories are narrated made me feel like I was sitting around a campfire with other bug hunters, hearing about their stories...
