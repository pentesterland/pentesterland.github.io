twitter-description: Our weekly favorite websec videos, articles, tips, tweets and more, curated with love for hackers by a hacker!
---
Hey hackers! These are our favorite resources shared by pentesters and bug hunters last week.

This issue covers the week from 02 to 09 of November.

## Our favorite 5 hacking items

### 1. Conference of the week
> [Wild West Hackin' Fest 2018](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCef0TWni8ghLcJphdmDBoxw/videos), especially:
  - [Hack for Show, Report for Dough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_LBWqNDY0M)
  - [The Top 10 Reasons It's GREAT to Be a Pen Tester... And How You Can Help Fix that PROBLEM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiOiYDmRW4g)
  - [What to Expect When You Are Expecting...a Penetration Test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJatJZI__V4)

Wild West Hackin' Fest is a relatively new security conference by Black Hills Security, a company known for its penetration testing services.I've already shared with you many of their high-quality webcasts on penetration testing.

This time, it's no different. These 3 talks present pentesting tips, tricks, and traps. They could help if you're considering becoming a professional pentester.

### 2. Writeup of the week
> [Evernote For Windows Read Local File and Command Execute Vulnerabilities](https://paper.seebug.org/737/)

This is a write-up for a stored XSS affecting the Evernote desktop app (version 6.14). The bug itself is simple:
- Create a note & add a picture to it
- Rename the picture to: `" onclick="alert(1)">.jpg`
- The JS payload will execute every time you open the note
- Share the note with other Evernote users (This isn't a self-XSS)

Since the JavaScript runs in the context of a desktop app, it can retrieve local files (LFI) and execute commands (RCE).

An XSS leading to RCE is unusual since it is a client-side vulnerability. I think it's really cool!

### 3. Resource of the week
> [Getting started in Bug Bounty](https://medium.com/@ehsahil/getting-started-in-bug-bounty-7052da28445a)

This is one of the best guides to get started in bug bounty I've seen out there! It lists many Twitter & Github accounts to follow, blogs, books, etc.

In addition to technical references, it also encompasses essential non technical advice like:

> No one will be able to tell you everything about this field, It’s a long path but you have to travel it alone with help from others.
> “Do not expect someone will spoon feed you everything.”

This can't be overstated...

### 4. Non technical item of the week
> [On Empathy in Security](https://blog.nuna.com/empathy-cybersecurity-6b3d0b2b1ab1)

This is a nice piece on security & empathy.

It particularly resonated with me because one of the first things I learned as an IT security auditor was the right posture to adopt with a client or auditee: Never make fun of their bugs or lack of security on their products. Never make them feel inferior just because they didn't know how to properly secure an asset. Explaining bugs, risks and mitigation is what will help them improve their overall security, not a bad attitude.

So empathy in security actully makes a lot of sense.

Empathy towards attackers too, though it might seem weird. I'm reminded of an article I've read recently (but can't find anymore) on cryptocurrency theft. Someone was contacted by a young blackhat. They talked for hours and the victim managed to get back all his money just by talking with and showing genuine empathy to the hacker. He was just a young guy in a bad situation.

### 5. Tip of the week
> [Passive DNS for the Bad](https://blog.rootshell.be/2018/11/09/passive-dns-for-the-bad/)

This is a simple yet effective trick. It's for when you find IP addresses with open Web ports (80, 443, 8080...), that can't be accessed directly. If the server uses a reverse proxy and blocks access by IP, you will have to find the right hostnames resolving to the IP you have.

Passive DNS databases (like DNSDB) are a good resource to get hostnames from IPs and maybe access endpoints that other hunters/pentesters might have missed.
