twitter-description: Our weekly favorite websec videos, articles, tips, tweets and more, curated with love for hackers by a hacker!
---
Hey hackers! These are our favorite resources shared by pentesters and bug hunters last week.

This issue covers the week from 21 to 28 of December.

 Also, I wish you and your family a very happy new year, full of bugs, bounties, fun, health & happiness!

## Our favorite 5 hacking items

### 1. Tip of the week
> <img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/newsletters/T5HN34-tweet.png" alt="Did you know you can smuggle payloads in a valid e-mail address using round brackets? " >

I love the technical tricks for bug hunters that @intigriti shares on Twitter. I regularly add them to the tweets collection at the end of this newsletter.

But this trick in particular blew my mind! Here's why: Have you ever tested a login or contact form, entered a valid email address, intercepted the request with Burp, then replaced the email with XSS/SQLi/SSTI/RCE detection payloads? This is a way to bypass client-side validation of the email field. So what do you do if you get an "invalid email" response from the server?

To me, its was the end of testing for input validation on that field because the check is done server-side.

But according to @securinti, you can smuggle any payload and trick the server into believing that it's a valid email by putting the payload between round brackets: yourname@**`(${}<>'/"*-)`**domain.com or yourname**`(${}<>'/"*-)`**@domain.com.

Amazing, right? I can't wait to re-test all forms in my bug bounty notes.

### 2. Writeup of the week
> [From Hunting for a Laptop to Hunting down Remote Code Execution](https://medium.com/@aniltom/from-hunting-for-a-laptop-to-hunting-down-remote-code-execution-72cce2761846)

This is the writeup of a WebDAV RCE on Asus. It's a simple but powerful vulnerability to test for if you see a 403 error page typical of Microsoft Server.

Anil Tom found one on <http://stw.asus.com/> and tried to add the website as a new network location on his laptop, to see if WebDAV is enabled on the server.\\
It worked! So just by adding <http://stw.asus.com/> as a network location, he was able to create new files on the server!

### 3. Resource of the week
> [JSONBee](https://github.com/zigoo0/JSONBee)

More and more sites use the Content Security Policy especially those that have a bug bounty program. So this repo can come in very handy if you find an XSS and want to bypass CSP.

If you just want the list of payloads to bypass CSP for different sites (Google, Blogger, Uber, Yahoo, Alibaba...), check out the file Jsonp.txt.

Otherwise, you can get more information on CSP and JSONbee on the [Bypassing CSP: Automated discovery of JSONP endpoints](https://www.slideshare.net/Hacken_Ecosystem/ebrahem-hegazy-bug-hunters-manual-for-bypassing-contentsecuritypolicy) conference slides.

And you can play with csp_lab.php as a testbed to train for byassing CSP.

### 4. Tool of the week
> [PA Toolkit](https://github.com/pentesteracademy/patoolkit): Pentester Academy Wireshark Toolkit

I've always had trouble remembering the syntax of Wireshark filters, so this tool is a blessing.

It's a collection of plugins that extend the functionality of Wireshark. They allow you to quickly get a list of all visited websites, downloaded files, POST/GET requests, list DNS servers, etc. 

### 5. Tutorial of the week
> [How To Exploit PHP Remotely To Bypass Filters & WAF Rules](https://www.secjuice.com/php-rce-bypass-filters-sanitization-waf/)

I love me some good WAF/filter bypass techniques! It's what makes a difference between being stuck in front of a WAF and finding bugs that other hunters missed even in old programs. 

This is a great tutorial on how to bypass different PHP filters like: `/etc/passwd`, the `system()` function or double & single quotes (`“` and `‘`) being blocked. It's worth reading & taking notes of tricks to test on your next bug hunt/pentest.
