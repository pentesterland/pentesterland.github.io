twitter-description: Our weekly favorite websec videos, articles, tips, tweets and more, curated with love for hackers by a hacker!
---
Hey hackers! These are our favorite resources shared by pentesters and bug hunters last week.

So this issue covers the week from 16 to 23 of November.

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{{ page.image }}" alt="T5HN29.png" >
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

On a personal note, really sorry for the delay. I've been under the weather and am still recovering. I'm also working on a training course and a new very exciting project. So there may be less articles (than usual) published in the next few weeks.

## Our favorite 5 hacking items

### 1. Slides of the week
> [Bug bounty funshop](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cpcxEBEb0dyXwRqSWQ6bknJS-PQO_e242Dioy9SU2Io/edit)

This is a great presentation for both web app pentesters & bug hunters. It presents a lot of tools, techniques and tips around recon, Burp Suite, reporting, testing mobile apps, etc.

I devoured it to add anything new to my current methodology. Hopefully, the video will be made public too.
<!--more-->

### 2. Tool of the week
> [Lazyrecon fork](https://github.com/plenumlab/lazyrecon)

The original [Lazyrecon](https://github.com/nahamsec/lazyrecon) is a Bash script by @nahamsec to automate reconnaissance. It creates a dated folder with recon notes, does subdomain enumeration, screenshots, port scanning, file/directory brute-force, etc.

This fork by @plenumlab builds on these features and adds other useful ones: notifications for potential NS subdomain takeover, subdomain enumeration with massdns, finds target's IP address space and dead DNS records...

This is a good tool to use as is, or to analyze and maybe get new ideas for improving your own recon tools.

### 3. Writeup of the week
> [Authentication bypass on NodeSJ app (private program)](https://medium.com/bugbountywriteup/authentication-bypass-in-nodejs-application-a-bug-bounty-story-d34960256402)

This is an interesting authentication bypass, due SQL injection on a JavaScript app.

The app expects this kind of POST data: `{“username”:”bl4de”,”password”:”secretpassword”}`. Poking with it showed that:
- `{“username”:[[]],”password”:”secretpassword”}` triggers a MySQL error typical of SQL injection
- `{“username”:[0],”password”:”secretpassword”}` triggers a request to port 21110 with an Authorization header (for Basic auth) including *secretpassword* and the username *super.adm*. But the password is rejected
- `{"username":[0,1,2,30,50,100],"password":"secretpassword"}` allows enumerating other usernames (but password still rejected)
- `{“username”:[0],”password”:true}` triggers a request to port 21110 resulting in successful authentication as the *super.adm* user!

### 4. Tutorial of the week
> [Browsing the Internet While Using Burp Suite: and Other Productivity Hacks](https://medium.com/@nemesiscontreras/browsing-the-internet-while-using-burp-suite-and-other-productivity-hacks-f2d86e80c331)

Do you use the same browser instance to browse the Internet while doing tests and intercepting all requests with Burp? If yes, this tutorial is for you! Leverage Chrome browser profiles to run multiple instances at the same time: One for testing, one normal browsing, one for sensitive sites (like banking apps)...

I've been doing this for years with the Profile Switcher extension. I prefer Firefox to Chrome, but this extension is incompatible with the latest versions of Firefox.\\
If you know an equivalent and up-to-date Firefox extension, please share it with us!

### 5. Conference of the week
> [NDC Sydney 2018](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL03Lrmd9CiGcqxJg1msfNXQ8tHLhXs4O7), especially:
  - [Modern web application bugs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqFqN8A7waQ)
  - [There are no snow days when you work remote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01otPuAPOJo&list=PL03Lrmd9CiGcqxJg1msfNXQ8tHLhXs4O7&t=0s&index=108)

I love these two talks! The first one is about advanced bugs that have become very popular in the bug bounty world (template injection, web cache poisoning, XXE, XSLT, SSRF...).\\
They are less known than XSS, SQL injection, open redirect, etc, but can have serious impacts and be highly rewarded.

The second one is almost an hour full of tips to help you decide if remote work is something for you or not, and how to navigate it successfully. A must watch if you're considering remote work!
