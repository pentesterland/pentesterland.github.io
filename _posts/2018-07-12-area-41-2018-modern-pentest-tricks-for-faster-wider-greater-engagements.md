## What changed and why you need to adapt?
### In 2018 it is easily possible to:
- Scan the entire IPv4 space in few minutes/hours/days
	- With **distributed (vulnerable) computing**: [Census 2012](http://census2012.sourceforge.net/paper.html)
	- With **asynchronous programming**: [ZMap](https://zmap.io/), [Masscan](https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/masscan), [Unicornscan](https://tools.kali.org/information-gathering/unicornscan)
	- With **third-party platforms** doing it **for you**, sometimes for **free**: [Shodan](https://www.shodan.io), [ZoomEye](https://www.zoomeye.org/) (the chinese Shodan, less restriction free, good data quality), [Scans.io](https://scans.io/), [Censys.io](https://censys.io/)
- Query all OSINT information you want
	- **Offline**, by building your own platform: [Modern Internet Scale Reconnaissance](https://github.com/hdm/2017-BSidesLV-Modern-Recon)
	- **Online**, by querying services like: [Recon-ng](https://bitbucket.org/LaNMaSteR53/recon-ng), [DomainTools](https://www.domaintools.com/) (not cheap but good data quality), [Pastebin](https://pastebin.com/), [Certificate Transparency](https://www.certificate-transparency.org/)...
- **Pwn** large **Windows corporate infrastructures**
	- Starting with reconnaissance
		- of assets: [PowerView](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/tree/master/Recon)
		- of admins: [BloodHound](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound)
	- Then through exploitation: [CrackMapExec](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/CrackMapExec), [Responder](https://github.com/SpiderLabs/Responder)
	- And just after, post-exploitation: [Mimikatz](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz), Invoke-Mimikatz (stealthy & partial version of Mimikatz), [Empire](https://github.com/EmpireProject/Empire)
	- Or...just automate everything in **one tool**: [Deathstar](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/DeathStar)

### Why  do you need to adapt your techniques?
Because:
- More & more security tools are writing more & more good quality & reliable tools
- You will be asked to cover wider scopes faster
- It has already changed

Current pentest assessment require pentesters to **SCALE**!

## Modern tricks for modern pentesters
### Data analysis & processing: CSV
- Pentest involves a lot of iterative work: scan & exploit targets, harvest data & use it on new & old targets
- So to scale, you need a good data format to quickly process new data on all pentest phases (recon, exploitation, post-exploitation & reporting)
- Use CSV for inputs & outputs. It is the best format for data analysis & processing
- It's a simple human-readable format but there is no standard for CSV
- CSV just means separate some stuff with another stuff (a delimiter like a comma)
- Best practices:
	- **Encoding**: **Use utf-8**
		- Python 2 "csv" module doesn't support utf-8, use *unicodecsv* instead
	- **Quoting & escaping**: choose to have **all fields** quoted to prevent CSV injection ([Example](http://georgemauer.net/2017/10/07/csv-injection.html))

#### Pentest/infosec tools offering CSV output
- [nmaptocsv](https://github.com/maaaaz/nmaptocsv)
- [wfuzz](http://wfuzz.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [testssl.sh](https://testssl.sh/)
- [BloodHound](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound)
- [Ophcrack](http://ophcrack.sourceforge.net/)
- [Recon-ng](https://bitbucket.org/LaNMaSteR53/recon-ng)
- [Nikto](https://cirt.net/Nikto2)
- [Nessus](https://www.tenable.com/)

#### Tools to handle CSV
- Microsoft Excel
	- Use the "Text to Columns" function to convert text to Excel columns & choose your delimiter, then use the "Filter" function
	- Con: Max number of lines is 1 million (~10 to 30 MB file, easily attainable, commonly encountered issue)
- [csvkit](https://csvkit.readthedocs.io/en/1.0.3/)
	- Free, open source, one of the best tools for CSV
	- Command-line suite
	- csvkit tools in a nutshell:

| **Input** |
| --- | --- |
| in2csv, sql2csv | convert anything to csv |
| <span style="color: green">csvclean, csvformat</span> |  <span style="color: green">ensure your inout or output files are correctly formatted</span> |

| **Processing** |
| --- | --- |
| csvcut | just like UNIX "cut" |
| csvgrep | not just like UNIX "grep", allows to search regex/patterns only in desired columns |
| <span style="color: green">csvjoin</span> |  <span style="color: green">execute an SQL-like join to merge CSV files on a specified column or columns</span> |
| csvsort | not just like UNIX "grep", allows to sort desired fields |
| csvstack | concatenate/merge multiple CSV files |

| **Output & Analysis** |
| --- | --- |
| csvjson | convert a CSV file into JSON |
| csvlook | just admire the beauty of a CSV file in your interpreter |
| csvpy | load a CSV file into a CSVKitReader object and then drop into a Python shell |
| <span style="color: green">csvsql</span> |  <span style="color: green">perform SQL queries on a CSV file</span> |
| <span style="color: green">csvstat</span> |  <span style="color: green">print some statistics per columns</span> |

- [Dataiku Data Science Studio (DSS)](https://www.dataiku.com/dss/trynow/)
	- Free & Enterprise editions, not Open Source
	- The free edition is enough
	- Allows to perform the same kind of processing than Excel but without size limitation
	- Intuitive, user-friendly & efficient
		- Only 4 hours on a 4 cores + 16 GB RAM machine to join the "hash" column a 30 GB uncompressed DB dump with a 4 GB "hash : cleartext"  file
	- [Official tutorials](https://www.dataiku.com/learn/guide/tutorials/basics.html)

### Parallel execution: GNU Parallel
- Pentest involves a lot of parallel work:
	- Extracting the results of a tool output on multiple targets
	- Launching the same bruteforce on multiple targets
- Parallel execution is crucial to scale on wide scopes
- GNU Parallel is a Perl script to **parallelize any command** and maximize I/O & CPU usage
- Useful options:

| --- | --- |
| `--progress` | a percentage of done/to be done |
| `--bar` | a nice progress bar | 
| `--joblog` | a log of executed tasks, allows resuming |
| `-- resume` | resume to your current execution status |
| `--sshlogin` | distribute the tasks on remote computers through SSH |

##### Example 1: Directory bruteforce
- Run *wfuzz* on *target_list.txt*
```console
$ parallel -a target_list.txt --joblog joblog --progress --bar 
	"wfuzz
		-f 'results/result_wfuzz_{= s/[:\/]/_/g =}.json',json
		--filter 'c<403'
		-R 3 -Z -c
		-z file, '/usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists/directory-list-lowercase-2.3-small.txt
		{1}/FUZZ"
```
	- `{= s/[:\/]/_/g}` is a Perl/sed expression to remove bad chars in filename
	- Format of *target_list.txt*:
```console
http://foo
https://foobar
https://bar:443
```
- Then filter results by 200 HTTP response code & get a screenshot of all responding URLs with [*webscreenshot*](https://github.com/maaaaz/webscreenshot)
```console
$ ls ./results/result_wfuzz_*.json | parallel
"cat {} | jq '.[] | if (.code == 200) then .url else empty end' | sed 's/"//g' >> list_to_webscreenshot.txt"
```

##### Example 2: DNS enumeration
- Reference: <http://mubix.github.io/blog/2014/01/29/hostname-bruteforcing-on-the-cheap/>
- Run *dig* on subdomains.txt
```console
$ parallel -a subdomains.txt --joblog joblog --progress --bar
	"dig +noall +answer {}.<target domain>"
```
	- Format of subdomains.txt:
```console
foo
bar
admin
```

##### Dig with GNU Parallel (*cheap* method) vs Gobuster (proper & optimized tool)
- [Gobuster](https://github.com/OJ/gobuster): Directory/file & DNS busting tool written in Go
```console
$ git clone https://github.com/OJ/gobuster.git && cd gobuster
$ time go run main.go -u google.com -w ~/subdomains.txt -m dns -q -o google.com_subdomains_by_gobuster.txt
```
=> ~22s

- Dig: Native tool for DNS enumeration
```console
$time parallel -a ~/subdomains.txt "dig +noall +answer {}.google.com | tee -a google.com_subdomains_by_parallel.txt"
```
=> ~27s

- Dig with GNU Parallel is almost as perfomant as Gobuster
- Very useful when you cannot install any tool on your attack machine (for example if provided by the client). You only have to install GNU Parallels

### High-level scripting languages for easier static & dynamic analysis: Jython & Frida
- Pentest sometimes involves reversing "custom-wtf" obfuscation or encryption
- Usually during **Android applications & Java thick clients** engagements
- Why use a high-level scripting language for instrumentation?
	- If you don't want to go down the rabbit hole to figure out how it works
	- If you can't replicate/rip the code into your favourite language
		- E.g.: Oracle WebLogic Server encrypts local passwords with a cryptosystem that's not implemented in any Python module
- Use **Jython** for **static analysis** of Android & Java apps
	- Writing Java code in Python... that can use Java classes... and Python libraries in the same snippet
- Use **Frida** for **everything else**
	- Writing Python or JS or QML or Swift or .NET... injecting C++ scripted in JS (Google v8)... to instrument ASM, Objective-C or Dalvik... on Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS
- Example: [WebLogic Server password decryptor](https://github.com/maaaaz/weblogicpassworddecryptor/) in Jython

### Compile Pythin scripts on-the-fly: PyInstall
- Pentest sometimes involves the need to have compiled version of tools
- Because:
	- The **target** you are onto does not have the **proper execution environment** (dependencies, interpreter) & you **can't install it** (no root, no outgoing connection, laziness...)
	- You **can't just have a proper reverse shell** or Meterpreter
	- You need to **evade antivirus**
- Compile Python tools with PyInstall
- PyInstaller **bundles a Python script with a Python interpreter**
- You can compile a script for Windows on Windows
	- Installing on Windows:
		- Install one ["Visual C++ Compiler for Python"](https://wiki.python.org/moin/WindowsCompilers)
		- $ `pip install pyinstaller`
		- This dependency is already satistied if you have Visual Studio installed
- You can also cross-compile for Windows from Linux with *wine* ([Tutorial](http://thanat0s.trollprod.org/2017/04/crosscompiler-un-python-en-pe-pour-windows-avec-juste-ton-linux-console/))
- Useful options:
	- `--onefile`: creates a **standalone executable file** which is a self-extracting zip payload
	- `--onedir`: creates a **single directory** with everything inside if you don't want a standalone executable file, as **large standalones** (> 18 MB) take time to unzip before execution
	- `--key <key>`: a **specific key** to encrypt the zip payload, of course included in the executable ([Tutorial](https://0xec.blogspot.com/2017/02/extracting-encrypted-pyinstaller.html))
		- Encrypt the payload & include the key in the executable (no obfuscation used), useful for anti-virus bypass
	- `--icon <icon_file>`: for visual fanciness

#### Examples of Python scripts compiled with PyInstaller
- Impacket examples
	- [Impacket example scripts compiled for Windows](https://github.com/maaaaz/impacket-examples-windows)
	- [Practical Usage of NTLM Hashes](https://blog.ropnop.com/practical-usage-of-ntlm-hashes/)
	- High-value utilities in the Impacket tool suite: *mimikatz.exe*, *ntlmrelay.exe*, *psexec.exe*, *samrdump.exe*, *secretsdump.exe*, *smbexec.exe*, *smbrelay.exe*, *ticketer.exe*, *wmiexec.exe*, *wmipersist.exe*, *wmiquery.exe*
	- Real-life tricks
		- Impacket tools are gaining popularity and getting flagged by AV. Just use the `--key` option to bypass them!
		- If you cannot grab the *Ntds* database (*Ntds.dit*) of a domain because of the network connection or not enough space on your computer, just take the *secretsdump.exe* executable & put it on the target or on the domain controller wherever you want & you'll be able to process the *Ntds* file remotely & grab password hashes from it
- [Patator compiled for Windows](https://github.com/maaaaz/patator-windows/)
- [CrackMapExec compiled for Windows](https://github.com/maaaaz/CrackMapExecWin)
	- Thomas is the *unofficial official* maintainer of the compiled version 2
	- Version 2 is old but is UTF-8 compatible (useful for pentesting sites containing accents like French sites)
- [jdwp-shellifier compiled for Windows](https://github.com/maaaaz/jdwp-shellifier-windows)

##### Demo
- Compile [*rpivot*](https://github.com/klsecservices/rpivot) from Linux for Linux
```console
git clone https://github.com/klsecservices/rpivot.git
cd pivot
pyinstaller --clean --onefile server.py
./dist/server -h
```

### Searching code: Stop using *grep*
- Alternatives to *grep*:
	- [*sift*](https://sift-tool.org/)
	- [*ripgrep*](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)
	- [*Silver Searcher*](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher)
- They have more options & better performances

## Taking a step back
Conclusion:
- CSVKit
- Dataiku
- GNU Parallel
- Jython
- Frida
- PyInstall\\
... all the things!
