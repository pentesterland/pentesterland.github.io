twitter-description: Our weekly favorite websec videos, articles, tips, tweets and more, curated with love for hackers by a hacker!
---
Hey hackers! These are our favorite resources shared by pentesters and bug hunters last week.

This issue covers the week from 21 to 28 of February.

## Our favorite 5 hacking items

### 1. Conference of the week
> [AppSec California 2020](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhaoFbw_ejdo-4nSeRKNH1pRhdfsn3CI7)

So many good talks and prestigious speakers! Topics range from Web security to Cloud, Kubernetes, Credential stuffing, DevSecOps, Car hacking and more.

I'm starting with [JWT Parkour - Louis Nyffenegger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWVRHK3ykfo&list=PLhaoFbw_ejdo-4nSeRKNH1pRhdfsn3CI7&index=40&t=0s) and [Are You Properly Using JWTs? - Dmitry Sotnikov](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3jA0bGDCso&list=PLhaoFbw_ejdo-4nSeRKNH1pRhdfsn3CI7&index=15&t=0s). What about you?

### 2. Writeup of the week
> [Write-up: AWS Document Signing Security Control Bypass](https://medium.com/@ozguralp/write-up-aws-document-signing-security-control-bypass-2b13a9c22a4d) ($1,000)

This is a writeup of an interesting bug found by analyzing a file upload functionality. It used AWS for storing documents uploaded, and AWS signing to authorize access to files.

By manipulating a request parameter, @ozgur_bbh was able to bypass the signing mechanism and access all documents in the S3 bucket.

### 3. Videos of the week
> - [@zlz Talks About How He Got Started, Recon, Hacking @Tesla, and Working With @Theparanoids](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TsHmWBxUz8)
> - [How to Use Firefox Containers for Easy IDOR Hunting (With Demo!)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeDb9ugIGYs)

I don't think I will ever get bored of watching interviews with hackers. This one is with @zlz. It is fascinating to learn about his thought process, his unique recon process, how he approaches full-time bug hunting, how he is able to get a sense of applications that are probably vulnerable based on past experience, etc.

The second video may be the fastest way to learn how to use Firefox Containers. They are very useful for both Web hacking (IDOR and authorization tests) and segregating accounts during normal navigation.

### 4. Article of the week
> [Gehaxelt - How Wordpress Plugins Leak Sensitive Information Without You Noticing](https://blog.detectify.com/2020/02/26/gehaxelt-how-wordpress-plugins-leak-sensitive-information-without-you-noticing/)

This in an interesting read for anyone interested in doing research and submitting new modules to Detectify. @gehaxelt explains his process for analyzing the most popular Wordpress plugins and finding information leaks. 

### 5. Tutorial of the week
> [Bypassing OkHttp Certificate Pinning](https://captmeelo.com/pentest/2020/02/24/bypass-okhttp-cert-pinning.html) & [Reddit discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/comments/f8pegs/bypassing_okhttp_certificate_pinning/)

This tutorial might be helpful if you are struggling with certificate pinning bypass. @CaptMeelo shows a nice trick he used when Xposed Modules and Frida were not working.

He looked at the system log while the app was running. Certificate fingerprints appeared in the log. He decompiled the app, identified where the fingerprints were located and added one for his Burp certificate. Recompiling the app and running this patched version allowed him to bypass certificate pinning without having to modify smali code.
