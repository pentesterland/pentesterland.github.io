twitter-description: Our weekly favorite websec videos, articles, tips, tweets and more, curated with love for hackers by a hacker!
---
Hey hackers! These are our favorite resources related to pentesting and bug hunting that we came across the last few days.

This issue covers the week from 24 to 31 of August.

## Our favorite 5 hacking items

### 1. Guide of the week
> [The Complete Guide to CORS (In)Security](https://www.bedefended.com/papers/cors-security-guide) by Bedefended

This is a comprehensive guide to CORS for security professionals. It's the best document that I've seen on this subject, covering everything from an introduction to the basics of SOP (Same-Origin Policy) and CORS, to attacks and mitigations, with references to the existing research on this topic.

### 2. Video of the week
> [Christina Camilleri: Security Solutions Specialist for Riot Games \| Play Makers Episode 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ysg93rGDYw) by Travis Gafford

Wow, I could not get my eyes of Christina during this interview. I'm usually not into "My path to infosec"-type interviews but this one is fascinating: She shares stories of physical pentests, insights into social engineering, why security is so important for a video game company... all with glimmering eyes that are a testament to her passion!

### 3. Writeup of the week
> [Remote code execution by hijacking an unclaimed S3 bucket in Rocket.Chat's installation script.](https://hackerone.com/reports/399166) by @EdOverflow

This is a simple bug but very creative!

My main takeway is to always carefully read the source code if you have access to it.\\
In the latest release of Rocket.Chat, an install.sh script contained a curl request to retrieve a file from an unclaimed S3 bucket. So by creating a bucket with the same name, Ed could make users download any files from his bucket.

### 4. Tool of the week
> [getsploit](https://github.com/vulnersCom/getsploit) by @VulnersCom

This is a simple but useful command-line tool to search for vulnerabilities listed in *vulners.com*, the same way *searchsploit* searches for vulnerabilities in *exploit-db.com*.

### 5. Non technical item of the week
> [AWS Slurp Github Takeover](https://medium.com/@SweetRollBandit/aws-slurp-github-takeover-f8c80b13e7b5) by @SweetRollBandit

This is a good reminder to always read the source code of github repositories before executing any script file in them.\\
That said, if anyone has a copy of the real Slurp repo, would you please send it to me? I couldn't find it anywhere!
